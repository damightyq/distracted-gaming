# The Official Distracted Gaming Website Source Code
Hey! This is the source code for our website. This contains our main page, GamePlanner pages, icons and other stuff too.

We used GitHub and it's Pages tool because: 

1. It's free to use 
2. We have pretty much everything in our hands to make the website any way we want to. Not like Squarespace or stuff like that. Blegh! 
3. It's open source and we can work on it together all at once!

The website is still under construction, so everything (except the branding for now), is not final.
