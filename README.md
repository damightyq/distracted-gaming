Hey! This is the source code for our website. This contains our main page, GamePlanner pages, icons and other stuff too.

We used GitHub and it's Pages tool because, a: it's free to use, b, we have pretty much everything in our hands to make the website any way we want to. Not like Squarespace or stuff like that, blegh, and c: it's open source and we can work on it together all at once!
